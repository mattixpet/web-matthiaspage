<h3>Quotes</h3>
<p class="articletext">"There is such plethora of music in today's world and really no lack of musicians. The way I see it, you can either search long enough for a musical piece which is almost exactly what you envision in your head, or you can sit down and write it yourself. Personally I find the latter to be easier." </p>
<p class="articletext">"When I was younger I used to record ideas for songs everytime I got them so that one day when I'd be 'grown up and a songwriter' I would use them if I needed some materal. Turns out, there is no moment in time when you suddenly wake up a songwriter, you just have to go right now and write songs, do what you want to do."</p>
