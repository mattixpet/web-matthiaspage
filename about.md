<h1>About</h1>

<p class="articletext"> Classically influenced composer born in Reykjav√≠k. I write music because it's something to do and I feel like music is something special. I also know what I like and other music is not always pleasing to me so I want to add to the, albeit already large, flora which does please me (and perhaps you too). </p>

<p class="articletext"> If you are extremely curious try <span id="dungeon-link">entering the dungeon</span>. </p>

<h2>Quotes</h2>
<p class="articletext"> "There is such plethora of music in today's world and really no lack of musicians. The way I see it, you can either search long enough for a musical piece which is almost exactly what you envision in your head, or you can sit down and write it yourself. Personally I find the latter to be easier." </p>
